OpenShift Pipelines is provided as an OpenShift add-on that can be installed via an operator that is available in the OpenShift OperatorHub.

Operators may be installed into a single namespace and only monitor resources in that namespace, but the OpenShift Pipelines Operator installs globally on the cluster and monitors and manage pipelines for every single user in the cluster.

To install the operator globally, you need to be a cluster administrator user. In this workshop environment, the operator has already been installed for you. Nevertheless, this is the process we followed in order to install the operator. **These instructions are for reference, as you will not be able to see these screens in the embedded console in the workshop due to your user's lack of the required privileges.**


== Installing the OpenShift Pipelines Operator in Web Console

You can install OpenShift Pipelines using the Operator listed in the OpenShift Container Platform OperatorHub. When you install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, the Custom Resources (CRs) required for the Pipelines configuration are automatically installed along with the Operator.

Firstly, switch to the _Console_ and login to the OpenShift web console using the same credentials you used above.

In the _Administrator_ perspective of the web console, navigate to Operators → OperatorHub. You can see the list of available operators for OpenShift provided by Red Hat as well as a community of partners and open-source projects.

Use the _Filter by keyword_ box to search for `OpenShift Pipelines Operator` in the catalog. Click the _OpenShift Pipelines Operator_ tile.

Read the brief description of the Operator on the _OpenShift Pipelines Operator_ page. Click _Install_.

Select _All namespaces on the cluster (default)_ for installation mode & _Automatic_ for the approval strategy. Click Subscribe!

Be sure to verify that the OpenShift Pipelines Operator has installed through the Operators → Installed Operators page.

== Installing the OpenShift Pipelines Operator using the CLI

You can install OpenShift Pipelines Operator from the OperatorHub using the CLI.

First, you'll want to create a Subscription object YAML file to subscribe a namespace to the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, for example, `subscription.yaml` as shown below:

[source,yaml,role=copypaste]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: openshift-pipelines-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel:  ocp-4.6
  name: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh 
  source: redhat-operators 
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace 
----

This YAML file defines various components, such as the `channel` specifying the channel name where we want to subscribe, `name` being the name of our Operator, and `source` being the CatalogSource that provides the operator. For your convenience, we've placed this exact file in your `/operator` local folder. 

You can now create the Subscription object similar to any OpenShift object.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
`oc apply -f operator/subscription.yaml`
----

== Verify installation

The OpenShift Pipelines Operator provides all its resources under a single API group: tekton.dev. You can see the new resources by running: 

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc api-resources --api-group=tekton.dev
----

=== Verify user roles

To validate that your user has the appropriate roles, you can use the `oc auth can-i` command to see whether you can create Kubernetes custom resources of the kind needed by the OpenShift Pipelines Operator.

The custom resource you need to create an OpenShift Pipelines pipeline is a resource of the kind pipeline.tekton.dev in the tekton.dev API group. To check that you can create this, run:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc auth can-i create pipeline.tekton.dev
----

Or you can use the simplified version:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc auth can-i create Pipeline
----

When run, if the response is yes, you have the appropriate access.

Verify that you can create the rest of the Tekton custom resources needed for this workshop by running the commands below. All of the commands should respond with yes.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc auth can-i create Task
----

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc auth can-i create PipelineResource
----

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc auth can-i create PipelineRun
----

Now that we have verified that you can create the required resources let's start the workshop.

echo "Operator ready"
```{{execute-1}}

Great! The OpenShift Pipelines Operator is now installed. Now, let's start the workshop.
